The alert can be customized in the following three ways:

* For an alert that has a X to dismiss, leave Dismiss Button blank.

* For an alert that has a button to dismiss, fill in the Dismiss Button section.
* An alert that has a button that links to a page. That page can open in the same or new window.
* For a button that links out, fill in Alert URL Extras section and Show URL section.

If the url being used is to a third party site (a site outside of the Dominica site) the url requires http:// or https:// to work.

To include a url from the Dominica site, fill in the URL field with the last, relative part of the url. Ex. /experiences to link to the Experiences page.
